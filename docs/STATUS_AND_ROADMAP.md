# Skybloom: Status & Development Roadmap

## Current Status

Skybloom is an immersive 3D flying carpet adventure game built with Three.js. The game enables players to explore a procedurally generated world, collect mana, and enjoy the experience of magical flight.

### Core Systems Implemented

- **Engine System**: Core game loop, system management, renderer configuration
- **WorldSystem**: Advanced procedural terrain generation with biomes and features
- **PlayerSystem**: Flight physics, controls, and player management
- **AtmosphereSystem**: Sky rendering, clouds, weather effects
- **VegetationSystem**: Procedural tree and plant generation
- **WaterSystem**: Ocean, lakes, and water rendering
- **CarpetTrailSystem**: Visual flight effects, motion lines, and particles
- **LandmarkSystem**: Procedural points of interest (ruins, magical circles, etc.)
- **UISystem**: Basic player HUD and interface elements
- **NetworkManager**: Basic multiplayer capabilities

### Recent Improvements

1. **Enhanced Terrain Generation**:
   - Multi-octave noise for more natural landscapes
   - Better biome transitions based on temperature and moisture
   - Improved coloring and texturing
   - More varied terrain features (mountains, plateaus, valleys)
   
2. **Landmark System**:
   - Procedurally generated points of interest
   - Ancient ruins, magical circles, and crystal formations
   - Smart placement based on terrain suitability
   - Visual effects and animations
   
3. **Flight Visualization**:
   - Magic particle trails
   - Motion lines at high speeds
   - Steam/cloud effects
   - Ribbon trail showing flight path

### Current Architecture

The game uses a component-based architecture with systems that interact through the central Engine class. Each system is responsible for a specific aspect of the game and updates independently in the game loop.

```

## Known Limitations

1. **Asset Management**: Currently experiences 404 errors for missing assets, though fallback systems are in place
2. **Performance Optimization**: Needs Level of Detail (LOD) system for distant terrain
3. **Physics**: Basic collision detection with terrain but no advanced physics
4. **Multiplayer**: Basic framework exists but needs more robust implementation
5. **Mobile Compatibility**: Not yet optimized for mobile devices

## Next Steps

### High Priority Tasks

1. **Asset Creation & Integration**:
   - Create and include necessary 3D models (carpet, mana orbs)
   - Add proper textures for terrain, water, etc.
   - Implement sound effects and background music
   
2. **Gameplay Loop Enhancement**:
   - Implement spell system using collected mana
   - Add goals and objectives
   - Create progression system
   
3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement Level of Detail (LOD) for distant terrain
   - Optimize vegetation rendering with instancing
   - Add frustum culling for off-screen objects

### Medium Priority Tasks

1. **Improved Weather & Environment**:
   - Day/night cycle with lighting changes
   - Weather effects (rain, snow, fog)
   - Ambient creatures (birds, fish)
   
2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Minimap for navigation
   - Better mana and health displays
   - Spell selection interface
   
3. **Multiplayer Enhancements**:
   - Improved synchronization
   - Player interaction features
   - Shared world persistence

### Future Features

1. **Quest System**:
   - NPCs with dialog
   - Quest objectives and rewards
   - Story elements
   
2. **Expanded World**:
   - More landmark types
   - Dungeons and special locations
   - Secret areas with unique rewards
   
3. **Carpet Customization**:
   - Visual customization options
   - Performance upgrades
   - Special abilities

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Refactoring**:
   - Standardize naming conventions
   - Improve system coupling/cohesion
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   
2. **Testing Framework**:
   - Add unit tests for core systems
   - Implement performance benchmarking
   - Create stress tests for world generation
   
3. **Build Pipeline**:
   - Optimize asset loading and bundling
   - Implement proper versioning
   - Create deployment automation

## Conclusion

Skybloom has a solid foundation with key systems in place. The procedural world generation, flight mechanics, and visual effects create an engaging experience. By focusing on the priority tasks outlined above, the game can evolve into a fully-featured adventure with rich gameplay and visual appeal.

The most critical next step is completing the gameplay loop by implementing the spell system and objectives, giving purpose to the mana collection mechanic and providing players with goals beyond exploration.
