# Skybloom - Terrain and Atmosphere Fixes

This document explains the fixes made to address terrain glitches and cloud rendering issues in the Skybloom game.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Terrain Glitches**: Mountains and terrain were "glitching" with unnatural transitions between land and water, creating visual artifacts where terrain would appear to become water inappropriately.

2. **Floating Objects in Sky**: The clouds were appearing too basic and not blending well with the scene, creating an unnatural look.

## Technical Solutions

### World System Fixes

1. **Simplified Terrain Generation**: 
   - Reduced noise function complexity to create smoother terrain
   - Limited octaves in fractal noise to prevent excessive variation
   - Created more gradual transitions between land and water
   - Implemented smoother beaches and coastlines

2. **Improved Level of Detail (LOD)**:
   - Simplified LOD system with fewer but more effective detail levels
   - Improved material properties for each LOD level
   - Better terrain coloring with reduced visual artifacts

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Reduced geometry complexity where appropriate
   - Simplified material properties on distant terrain
   - More efficient memory management

### Atmosphere System Fixes

1. **Improved Cloud Rendering**:
   - Reduced cloud count for better performance
   - Enhanced cloud appearance with better geometries and materials
   - More natural cloud movement with reduced floating appearance
   - Added subtle wave motion to clouds for a more organic look

2. **Sky and Fog Improvements**:
   - Adjusted fog density for better terrain visibility
   - More consistent sky colors
   - Improved sky-terrain transition

## How To Apply Fixes

The fixes have been implemented in separate fixed files to allow safe comparison before application:

1. Run the included script to apply all fixes:
   ```
   node apply-fixes.js
   ```

2. This will:
   - Backup your original files to a "backups" folder
   - Apply the fixed versions of WorldSystem.js and AtmosphereSystem.js
   - Keep the fixed versions for reference

3. Restart your development server to see the changes.

## Manual Restoration

If you need to revert to the original files:
- Copy the files from the "backups" folder back to their original locations
- Or use version control to revert changes

## Technical Details

### Key Terrain Generation Improvements

The main issue was in the `getTerrainHeight()` function which had several complex noise functions that when combined created steep terrain transitions. The fix involved:

1. Rewritten continent mask handling with smoother transitions
2. More gradual ocean depth that transitions smoothly to land
3. Smoother beach and coastal zone implementation
4. Reduced mountain influence to avoid extreme height changes
5. Limited detail noise influence to prevent sharp terrain spikes

### Key Cloud Rendering Improvements

1. Reduced cloud particle count but improved individual particle quality
2. Used StandardMaterial with optimized settings for better cloud appearance
3. Implemented better repositioning logic when clouds move outside view
4. Added subtle animation to make clouds feel more natural
